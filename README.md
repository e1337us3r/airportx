A small airport application made in java for an assignment in my OOP-1 class.


![A gif of app demonstration](https://media.giphy.com/media/3oFzm1dXbZbyf3k80M/giphy.gif)<br>

Features:<br>
-View incoming and outgoing flights from a selected airport<br>
-View configurations of desired flight either by double clicking it from list view or by searching it with it's unique flight Id<br>
-Edit existing flights using their Id<br>
-Delete existing flights using their Id<br>
-Create new Flights<br>
-Note that all of the fields that can be entered by user is validated and exception handled.<br>
-Looping background music, can be controlled with F1(stop) and F2(continue)<br><br>

Some of the logic behind the app may seem irrational but these were in project requirements and had to be stuffed in.<br><br>
